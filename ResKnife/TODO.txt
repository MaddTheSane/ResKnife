// Global to-do list for the entire project
//  to-do items specific to an object are associated directly with that object in the header or implementation files

Create some nice icons instead of the crap ones we have now.
Auto-uncollapse list items in template editor when they are created and when a resource is opened.
Add preference to "Show Resource Fork even if empty."
Add viewers for MooV and PICT.
Modify -[Resource data] and -[Resource setData] to use ResourceManager functions behind the scenes instead of an NSData object. This should fix the problem with new resources not being saved at times.
